# cy2001-anomaly-classification
A repository for implementation for classification/anomaly detection models use to detect changes in time-series data. The datasets will not be included in the folder.

First, run the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook. Then feel free to explore the other notebooks.

Run in Python. Required libraries include:
•	NumPy: For numerical computing and working with arrays.
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	scikit-learn: For machine learning and data mining.
•	Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
•	Tensorflow/Keras: For implementation of LSTMs
•	ADTK: For implementation of LevelShiftAD
